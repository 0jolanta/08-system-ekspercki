Arthritis treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving joint function. You may need to try several different treatments, or a combination of treatments, before determining what works best for you.


Medications
Medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Common arthritis medications include:


Pain medications. These drugs help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation.


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs reduce both pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Oral NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation, and some may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.


Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs slow or stop the immune system from attacking the joints.


Therapy
Physical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercise can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding the joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted.


Surgery


If conservative measures do not help, your doctor may suggest surgery, such as:


Joint repair. In some cases, joint surfaces can be smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. This type of surgery can often be done arthroscopically - through small incisions over the joint.


Joint replacement. This procedure involves removing the damaged joint and replacing it with an artificial one. The most commonly replaced joints are the hip and knee.


Joint fusion. This procedure is more commonly used for smaller joints, such as the wrist, ankle and fingers. It involves removing the ends of two bones in a joint and then locking those ends until they fuse into one rigid unit.
